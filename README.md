# Learn Haskell by building a blog generator

We will implement a simple static blog generator in Haskell, converting documents written in our own custom markup language to HTML.

## [Building an HTML printer library](https://lhbg-book.link/03-html_printer.html)

In this part we'll explore a few basic building blocks in Haskell, including functions, types and modules, while building a small HTML printer library with which we will later construct HTML pages from our markup blog posts.

```bash
runghc hello.hs > hello.html
```
